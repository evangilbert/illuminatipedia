Animal welfare organizations are one of the components of the "humanitarian" disinfo network, that ranges from Amnesty International / Human Rights Watch to Doctors without Borders and Greenpeace: 
 
Why did illuminati create animal welfare organizations for the human cattle?
Goals:
Passing truth in plain sight. This ncludes:
1. - illuminati religion's commandment that all cattle (human or not) has the same "rights".
2. - how human cattle is fed with what is produced in animal factories.
 
Advancing the agenda "exterminate sub-human jews" ncludes:
3. - spread hatred against jews, calling for a "stop to the Sadistic Jewish Ritual Slaughter", while using words association to apply the psy-op technique "black is white": portray victims as butchers.
4. - use it as launching pad for statements such as "animal abuse was a holocaust."
 
Reductionism: "Animal warfare" organizations propagating #1, #3 or #4 immediately expose themselves as illuminati tools.
